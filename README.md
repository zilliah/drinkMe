## About

Made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the [Cocktail Picker API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).


## TIL

This was my first project using an API, and the biggest takeaway was to always check there are no typos in the URL. I also learned how to activate functions when text is entered into a field, instead of relying solely on button clicks.
